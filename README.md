### Drone Control Daughterboard Expansion

This is a hardware add-on 'lid' for the kimχ micro that adds drone control hardware
replacing a separate PX4 external embedded subsystem. The kimχ micro with the drone-
control add-on board is an all-in-one embedded drone and reover control system.

## Work In Progress

Stay tuned for updates to both the hardware and software as we add features and port
PX4 Autopilot to the i.MX8M Mini on-board embedded ARM m4 core
